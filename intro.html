            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am Shrija Dhakal, a enthusiastic 4th year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Geomatics Engineering at Kathmandu University.I am currently exploring the world of web development, focusing on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML helps me structure the content of a webpage, CSS allows me to style it and bring creativity to life, and JavaScript enables me to add interactivity. These core technologies are not only the foundation of modern web development but are also empowering me to build dynamic, user-friendly websites.</p>

            <h3>About the computation form</h3>
            <p>Creating a traverse computation form for a website involves building an interactive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form collects survey data such as bearing and distance, calculates coordinates, and displays the results dynamically. CSS enhances the design, making it user-friendly, while JavaScript handles the computations. This form simplifies land surveying tasks by automating the process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, it can include validation features to ensure data integrity during input.</p>
